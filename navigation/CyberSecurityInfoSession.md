2. Ransomware is importnat and steals hundreds of thousands of dollars from the economy and he stops that.

4. Hated and still and always hated computers. Wanted to work in internatinoal relations but ended up in cyber. Is easy and 
5. If just get into there, be nice, be a good person, be nice, be organized, be likable, be not like Ruhaan.
6. Don't be ignorant, and needs to learn how to learn quickly. Outreach is very important.
7. Artifical Intelligence, people might be lost through AI. Coders can be replaced by AI. This is the largest threat :P
8. Do a lot of reading, learns a lot of things. Need to have a network, to identify people who are good and talk to them. They will help you. In other words? Don't be introverted.

# Tricia Mercer - CPO at INDUS and board of directors member at San Diego Cyber Center of Exellence - INDUSTRY
1. Dealt with a seinor leader who has financial issues and found that the would steal company data and to disclose NDA's, and filed  lawsuit of them.

4. Mom wanted to learn about computers, then got her into wanting to track bad guys.
5. Have background in IT, be a good person. Build own network at home and try to hack your own network.
6. Get leadership to understand why you should do that and why it would be good. In other words, dumb it down so buisness leaders can understand whats going on.
7. In the next 5-10 years every entity is going to pritoritize cyber. Large companies do but smaller companies dont. Programmers have no clue how to secure code.
8. Staying informed, being curious, new things come out at any time. (HMM RUHAAN SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DO TO HELP US INSTEAD)

# Victor Nezeata - Founder and CEO of Cyber Brain Academy. Adjunt Professor at USD  - ACADEMIA
1. Mostly preventing people's personal information getting leaked, gets rid of old data in the system.
2. Helps prevent AI and how it it used as a cyber attack weapon. 
#### Zero Day - Vulernability that has no patch.
3. Best way to test home security is getting a real hacker to break into your system. Ethical hackers are the hackers that do it. Rembmber to check ethical hackers and how they do things
4. Officer in the army. Wanted to be a software developer but realized he did not like it, but then fell in love with cyber security.
5. Get background in IT. Is easier to get job and understand while knowing how IT.
6. In his time at Kuwait he had to pick 5 to move into the country and to live in. Cybercurity is also dependentt on people, where the employees and staff are still very important (because they are the people doing cybersecurity)
7. More specalization in Healthcare IT. Healthcare is very different because theres more risk, such as instead of just computers there are people at risk. Try to educate the current workforce to have similar skillset that hackers have.
8. Have to constantly learn, just like how medicine does. Cybercurity is simlilar to a team sport. NEEDS COLLABORATION. github??? open source :D. Community helps a lot.
